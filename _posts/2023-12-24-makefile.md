## Makefile
In this post I'm gonna talk about Makefile.

So, what's Makefile?

Makefile consists of a set of rules, which help's too reduce repeatable commands.

For example when we compile our C codes we need 'gcc -flag -flag ... file.c file2.c ....' quite long code, but with the Makefile it will gonna reduce like 'make all' or some command what you set. 

Also after make the Makefile we can keep reuse by just fix small part of Makefile.

I think this is the main reason that we have to learn how to make and use the Makefile.

```Makefile
GCC = gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror     #gcc command with flags
NAME = filename-we-want.a
MAKE = make

PRINTFS = ./ft_printf.c		\
		  ./print_char.c	\
		  ./print_str.c

OBJS = $(PRINTFS:.c=.o)      #files in printf .c to .o file renaming

all: $(NAME)        
#when we use command 'make all' it will go to $(NAME)
#also it will do same with command 'make filename-we-want.a'

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
	$(MAKE) -C ./libft/
	cp ./libft/libft.a $(NAME)
	ar -rc $@ $^
#the first line is to make command for libft cause I also wanted to use my codes in libft project. so generate libft.a file with first line.
#on seconde line we copy libft.a to filename-we-want.a
#and use last command to archaive left .o files in printf project.


%.o : %.c
	$(GCC) -I . -c -o $@ $^
#this command will run when $(NAME) start.
#here we change .c to .o file.
# $@ is every thing on left side of : and $^ is every thing right
#So this code also able to look like below
# $(GCC) -I . -c -o %.o %.c

clean: 
	$(MAKE) clean -C ./libft/
	rm -rf $(OBJS)
#doing the clean command in libft first and also clean printf

```

This is the basic Makefile explain but you can make more useful for your work.
Hope my explain helps bit more to understand the code.

-C flag for make
> -C dir, --directory=dir 
> **Change to directory dir before reading the makefiles or doing anything else.**  
> If multiple -C options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: -C / -C etc is equivalent to -C /etc.  
> This is typically used with recursive invocations of make.

-o flag for gcc
> Specify the output filename using -o
> gcc main.c -o Filename

-I flag for gcc
>This flag is used to specify additional directories where header files are located. It helps the preprocessor find the necessary headers when compiling the code.

-r flag for ar
>Replace or add the specified files to the archive.  
>If thearchive does not exist a new archive file is created.  
>Files that replace existing files do not change the order of the files within the archive.  New files are appended to the archive
