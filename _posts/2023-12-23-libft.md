First project after piscine is Libft. In this project we recode lots of functions, most of them has explain in man. But also we have to make that subject asked to us.

## Makefile
In this subject we need Makefile. If you already done C 09 during the Piscine it will be not a problem. But if you see the Makefile for the first time I think you'll struggled a lot with Makefile also.

For understand Makefile I recommand this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/DtGrdB8wQ_8?feature=shared). It's quite long but he explain step by step.

So, the main point of Makefile is *gether of the shell commands*.
We just give the name to use more convinient.

It means when you want to make some file like .c file to .o you have to look for comfile command for linux not just try to looking for exact Makefile what you want on the internet.

## My mistakes
Now I'm gonna share my mistakes.

First, my mistake was in calloc. I had to check overflow with calloc but I missed it. Cause that's one of big different between malloc.

Second, usesof free(). I thought when we some string like this free(str) the str is automatically become NULL but other friend told me it doesn't work like that so I have to assign NULL directly after free.

```c
void *somefunc(chat *str){
  free(str)
  str = NULL;
  return (NULL);
}

arr = somefunc(arr);
```

So, I had to return NULL to array out of function.

Lastly, was in strdup(), in this function we have to send new string so even though we just want to send back str1 or str2 we have to make new array and put same contents inside and resend it.

And actually those mistakes are not checked by moulinette but it'll be a problem in peer evaluation. So always check carefully!
