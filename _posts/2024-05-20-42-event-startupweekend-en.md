It was 5, Avril of 2024. 

Before start I was worried quite a lot because still I am not good at French. But I really wanted to try, cause I can not keep avoid things because of my French. 

So I tried!! Just applied it!

Like un ad of Nike 'JUST DO IT' XD

Finally, the time to start the StartupWeekend is come.
Luckly I could meet my school friends infront of event place. And most of them were able to speak english.
So with they're help I could enter the event hall.

In the event first we recived our name-tag and T-shirt.
In the name-tag there was three words to fine fisrt team to enjoy the orientation.

After the orientation there was speech of projects. Now it's time to choose the project we want to join.

There was a lot of interesting projects and I could found project that I want to join!

It's was ROADIES :D (Well at the beignning it was NUAGE but we changed the name)
